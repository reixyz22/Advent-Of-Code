# Advent of Code

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** project! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, an annual series of coding puzzles that provide a fun way to practice problem-solving and programming skills.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event featuring 25 days of programming puzzles from December 1st to 25th. Each day includes two parts, making a total of 50 questions. Participants solve puzzles to earn stars and compete on a global leaderboard.

## Repository Overview

This repository includes my solutions to **8 days** (16 parts) from the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. This is a **work in progress**, and I am hopeful to complete all 50 parts by the end of the event. My goal is to improve my coding skills, explore different algorithms, and enjoy solving these creative problems.

### Structure

The solutions are organized by day. Each folder follows the format:

```
DayXX/
    ├── input.txt  # Puzzle input
    ├── solution.py  # Python script for the solution
    ├── README.md  # Brief explanation of the solution and approach
```

### Solved Questions

- **Year:** 2024
- **Days Solved:** 8 days (16 parts).
- **Programming Language:** Python

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the corresponding folder and execute the script. For example:

```bash
cd Day01
python solution.py
```

Make sure the `input.txt` file is present in the same directory as the script.
